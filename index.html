    <h2>What is Clash Royale?</h2>

    <p>Clash Royale is a strategy game focused on collecting cards and battling others. The game
        makes players defend their towers with characters in the form of cards. There are two side
        towers and one main tower, which has a king sitting on a throne on it. Destroying a tower
        gives the player one crown, and the first player to destroy all towers or destroy the king's
        tower wins. There are also different arenas, which have different conditions from each other,
        allowing for different characters to be used in different arenas. Make sure to see our
        <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/blank.html">Best Decks per Arena</a> section for more information.
        The game is ranked, with a player's rating being shown through trophies, which can
        be gained or lost in games. Below is a screenshot of a game of Clash Royale:<br><br><br>
